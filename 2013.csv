We moved and were closed for 5 weeks during July and August so there was no circulation and no programming. When we reopened August 6, we were on CWMARS and we did not carry over our patron database, everyone was entered into the system as they came into the library. Two thirds of our collection went into storage and is unavailable for borrowing. Between this fact and the way CWMARS operates our browsing collection was pretty much nil. As soon as new books arrived, they immediately went into the system ques leaving very few new items for browsing. Yet the staff tells me that they have been busier than ever and I see long lines at the circulation desk, but the circulation is cut in half. Since I am not familiar with the CWMARS software and how it calculates statistics, I do not know if our books being checked out at other libraries gives us the credit or if it goes to the other library.
