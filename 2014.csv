We relocated all library services to an offsite location (formerly a library branch, but vacant since 2009), which was open to the public from mid-November until the end of January. In addition, we closed for two weeks on either end to pack and move. The alternate location was significantly smaller; we were only able to bring about a third of our regular collection during this time, while the remaining collection was unavailable to our patrons, and the rest of our Consortium, for over three months. Also, the temporary location offered no programming space, so the few programs we maintained had to be done off-site. The 4 weeks of total closure during the project -- coupled with the staff time that was redirected from normal tasks to managing the project -- resulted in significantly lower circulation, reference, and program numbers during this period of time.",416,Yes,2,Yes,Yes,30,Yes,No,Yes,215,Friends of the Boxford Town Library,Suzanne Malach,suzken@verizon.net,,,0,7,0,0,0,,7,No,town library,city/town,library trustees,Yes,library trustees,0.2719,0.0744,76,37.5,0,No,No,"5,700",1841,1983,14,36,0,0,0,0

Although we secured a wonderful space for the temporary library and were able to make our entire collection available, we have not returned to normal service levels. Our Circulation numbers for the Fiscal Year ending 2014, were down 23.75% One immediate consequence of the move into a two-story building was to have more staff covering in the evenings. Hence, we now close at 5 p.m. on Thursdays in order to have a minimum of five staff members in the building at night.
